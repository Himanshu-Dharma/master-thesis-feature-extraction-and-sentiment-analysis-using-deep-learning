# Analyzing consumer impressions in E-commerce data through feature extraction and sentiment analysis using deep learning

Technology transformation is inevitable, transforming the functioning of our day-to-day life. 
This can be as simple as selecting different products for consumption. The importance of e-commerce is on the rise, especially in a post covid economy. 
Global e-commerce sales are anticipated to reach $6.5 trillion by 2023, according to a forecast by eMarketer Ethan Cramer-Flood, (2020). 
With this ever-increasing scale of E-commerce, businesses are generating enormous amounts of data. This data is incoming from multiple channels, like social media, customer reviews, feedback, and ratings. As more consumers turn to online shopping, businesses are rapidly investing in digital transformation and harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence in an effort to improve their offerings and better serve their customer expectations.


During this thesis, it will begin with exploring the existing research work in the direction of sentiment analysis. These studies focus on algorithms, techniques, and models like SVM, LSTM,
and BERT as well as the dataset employed and the evaluation metrics.
